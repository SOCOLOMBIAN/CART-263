This interactive game was build using JavaScript,html and Css. As well using SVG's for the shapes forms. The user needs to follow the computer generated sequence by clicking on the right sequences.

## Description 

that contains a brief artist's statement about your project. This statement should succinctly explain your artistic vision, the desired user experience, and how you believe you accomplished this both technically and artistically. This will help when evaluating the level of creativity you have brought to the project.

For this final project i was inspired by the use of sounds and colors. I wanted to create a game that make the user follow and engage with the sequence of the moving sound shapes. In this experience the shapes and the sounds are linking together but each next level the sound on each shape have different frequencies and durations. I wanted to create a game that stimulates the brain of the user, since the shapes where moving around the canvas and the frecuencies changing it need from the part of the user to engage within and be attentive. I also implemented a timer to give the game a sense of challenge.

The game i think in the technical side have a good aproach on terms of organization and clarity of the code. But i think i could have compact and structure the code better, specially on the main.js
