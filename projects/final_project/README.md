This interactive game was build using JavaScript,html and Css. As well using SVG's for the shapes forms. The user needs to follow the computer generated sequence by clicking on the right sequences.

## what it does 

the user has to read the instructions 

the user need to clik on start then in play sequence to initialize the game and the sounds 

the user repeats the sequence and if is good go to the next level: if wrong game over 

the level gets more complicated each time, the sequence became longer 


The user reads the intructions and start the game

## Description 

For this final project i was inspired by the use of sounds and colors. I wanted to create a game that make the user follow and engage with the sequence of the moving sound shapes. In this experience the shapes and the sounds are linking together but each next level the sound on each shape have different frequencies and durations. I wanted to create a game that stimulates the brain of the user, since the shapes where moving around the canvas and the frecuencies changing it need from the part of the user to engage within and be attentive. I also implemented a timer to give the game a sense of challenge.

The game i think in the technical side have a good aproach on terms of organization and clarity of the code. But i think i could have compact and structure the code better, specially on the main.js and the movingShapes.js. those files structure could been better organize. But in general i think the rest of the files were well managed and clear to understand. The artistic expression was accomplished almost at what i wanted. For this project i keep the visual projection simpler and minimalistic. and focused on having a variety of sounds that were different at each time as well to make it more abstract i decided to create my own shapes forms. Also i wanted to make the game responsive to the user imputs, by providing comments with the feedback as well make the screen reactive to the user imput such as turning red o green depending on the action.
